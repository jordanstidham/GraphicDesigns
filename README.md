PROJECT DESCRIPTION									

I am the editor of bi-monthly presentation materials that contributes to increased cohesion between multiple departments at ORAU. The mission is to communicate and highlight one of the company’s five organizational unit’s objectives, work, and departments. Through this medium, I announce events, celebrate employee accomplishments, provide key guidelines to ensure safety, security, and quality, and promote science exploration. These presentations are created using Microsoft PowerPoint, average between 8-10 minutes in length, and viewed by 700 employees, including executive management. These presentations focus on business related content and updates from 25 groups. I design the layout, generate original content, and also manage 10 contacts to keep the news as up-to-date as possible. I am responsible for the production schedule.							
									
I am the co-editor of a quarterly email newsletter distributed internally among employees. The publication is issued to all employees within the organizational unit for the purpose of providing relevant news, updates, and articles related to the unit, the company, and STEM. The newsletter is created using Microsoft Publisher and viewed by 700 employees, including executive management. I assist in designing the layout, generating original content, and also managing numerous contacts to keep the news as up-to-date as possible. I am responsible for the production schedule.									
																
The promotional materials I developed are for the Community of Engagement (COE) team I am a memeber of at Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) and as interdisciplinary support for other groups in my department. I assisted in the development of a marketing release kit in support of a brand awareness initiative for the success stories program, a segment of the COE team. The marketing release kits contains a promotional flier, guidelines, and a list of verbiage for the site.									
																
(1) The flier is the component of the marketing release kit. I was given creative freedom. I used Adobe InDesign to create the document. The document was stored internally on the company's SharePoint site for version control and gives easy access for employees.												
(2) I also developed a second component of the media release kit, a common set of guidelines outlining various processes regarding submitting requests on the SharePoint site.
